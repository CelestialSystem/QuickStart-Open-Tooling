# Taking QuickStart to Production

Let's walk through the steps of creating the app we've been working on above in
a real world environment.

## Getting started
### Prerequisite
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (^6.9.2)

## Download the Sample Application

You can download from Github by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button. Then
just click "Download Zip" and save the file to your machine.

Once downloaded, move the folder to wherever you'd like your application to live.

Once you have your application where you want it, "cd" into its directory in your
Command Line Interface (CLI). Then, issue the following command:

    npm install

Next, run the following command to start the application:

    npm start

You can now visit the resulting address displayed in your console.  It will
usually be found here:

    http://localhost:1841/
